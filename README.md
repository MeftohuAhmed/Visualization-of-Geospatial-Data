# NYC Taxi Traffic Visualization Project

Welcome to the NYC Taxi Traffic Visualization Project! This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, geospatial analysis, and interactive data visualization using Python libraries. It offers a demonstration of my ability to work with real-world datasets to gain insights and create informative visualizations.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TLC Trip Record Data, containing New York City’s taxi traffic data. The original dataset has numerous columns providing basic information about each taxi trip. For this project, I've utilized a reduced version of the dataset from January 2013, which has been processed to include additional information about the trips.

### Project Tasks

This project encompasses the following key tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** I've performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is error-free and suitable for analysis.

2. **Geospatial Analysis:** The project involves geospatial analysis to visualize the movement of taxis across New York City. This includes plotting the routes and tracking minute-by-minute changes in their positions.

3. **Interactive Visualization:** To provide a comprehensive view of taxi traffic, I've used Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Mapbox to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- `scripts`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and other tasks.
- `images`: Screenshot and screen recordings for project documentation.
